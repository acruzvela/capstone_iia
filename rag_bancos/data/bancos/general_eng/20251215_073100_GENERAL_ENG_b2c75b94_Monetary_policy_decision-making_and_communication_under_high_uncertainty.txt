Monetary policy decision-making and communication under high uncertainty

This volume offers a unique window into the experiences of central banks across the Americas and beyond, providing a comprehensive view of how institutions have navigated uncertainty in recent times. Drawing on both survey-based evidence and in-depth case studies from individual central banks, the chapters explore the evolving role of scenario analysis, the integration of high-frequency data and expert judgment, and the increasing importance of transparent and adaptive communication. Real-world experiences from 10 countries illustrate the diversity of challenges they face and the range of innovative responses they have developed.
