Basel Committee shares report on interconnections between banks  and non-bank financial intermediaries

The report reflects the findings of an analysis conducted as part of the Committee's forward-looking work to identify and analyse risks and vulnerabilities to the banking system. The report identifies the services banks and non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) provide to each other and the trends shaping the relationship between them. The Committee will continue to monitor and investigate the interconnections between banks and NBFIs with a particular focus on synthetic risk transfers.
