CPMI-IOSCO assesses that the EU has implemented the Principles for financial market infrastructures for two FMI types, but recommends some improvements

The EU's framework for systemically important payment systems and central securities depositories/securities settlement systems is complete and consistent with the CPMI-IOSCO Principles for financial market infrastructures (PFMI) in most aspects.
The CPMI-IOSCO assessment identified some areas for improvement where implementation was broadly or partly consistent or not consistent with the PFMI.
The assessment reflects status of implementation as of October 2019. A separate assessment is to be conducted for United Kingdom.
