Post-GFC securitisation reforms and new initiatives: a comparative analysis

This paper aims to provide evidence-based analysis that could shed light on three aspects of the ongoing debate. First, it examines to what extent the post-GFC reforms have achieved their intended objectives. Second, it explores whether these reforms have led to unintended consequences. Finally, it considers whether there is a need to revisit and adjust the regulatory framework for securitisation.
