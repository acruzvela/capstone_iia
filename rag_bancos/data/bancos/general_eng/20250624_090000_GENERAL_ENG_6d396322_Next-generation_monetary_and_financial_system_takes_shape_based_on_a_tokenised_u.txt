Next-generation monetary and financial system takes shape, based on a tokenised unified ledger: BIS

Building on the proposal for a unified ledger, the "trilogy" of tokenised central bank reserves, commercial bank money and government bonds is the next logical step to deliver profound change for the financial system.
Tokenisation can enhance efficiency and open new possibilities in cross-border payments, securities markets and beyond, while maintaining the key principles of sound money: singleness, elasticity and integrity.
Stablecoins as a form of sound money fall short, and without regulation pose a risk to financial stability and monetary sovereignty.
