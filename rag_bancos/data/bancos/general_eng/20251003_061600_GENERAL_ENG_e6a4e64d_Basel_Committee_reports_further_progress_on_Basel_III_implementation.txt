Basel Committee reports further progress on Basel III implementation

Over the past 12 months, the final Basel III standards came into effect in more than 40% of the Basel Committee's 27 member jurisdictions. The revised credit risk and operational risk standards as well as the output floor are now in effect in around 80% of member jurisdictions. The Committee will continue to closely monitor and assess the full and consistent implementation of Basel III standards.
