Project Meridian FX shows possibility of cross-border linkages for FX transactions between wholesale payment infrastructures

Project Meridian FX proves that wholesale payment infrastructures, such as real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems, can be interoperable via new technologies for FX transactions.
The joint project between the Bank for International Settlements, Bank of England, Bank of France, Bank of Italy, Deutsche Bundesbank and European Central Bank explored synchronising foreign exchange (FX) transactions.
It demonstrated that FX transactions could be settled across jurisdictions and different types of infrastructures.
