Insurance companies in the Euro area: asset allocation and impact on financial markets

Euro area insurers manage several trillion euro in assets and take a long-term investment perspective. They hold more alternative and less liquid assets than in the past, partly resulting from the long period of low interest rates until 2022. As a result, their balance sheets have become less liquid and more sensitive to market conditions overall. Meanwhile their holdings of sovereign bonds show significant home bias, which may have even increased with quantitative easing policies. Sovereign bonds also serve as key liquidity source for insurers, who sell sovereign bonds to meet the liquidity needs in response to large claims after natural disasters. Thus, liquidity shocks can spill over from insurance to the sovereign debt markets, increasing market volatility. Capital markets union would likely help insurers diversify their bond portfolios and promote cross-country risk sharing.
